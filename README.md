# Apple_Developer_University
The purpose of this repo is to provide a learning path for those interested in making Apps for the Apple ecosystem. This repo is dynamic and will change as needed in order to povide a best consolidated. If you would like to contribute links or a different structure or path, please do a pull request and submit. All changes that add value to the repo will be considered.

NOTE: I'm not an affiliate of any of the link mentioned below. However I do ask that if you like a lot any of the free resources and the creator has a paid version, to consider buying to support their work!

### Overview
Learning to develop apps for the Apple ecosystem is a journey unto itself. It seems that a common starting point is to learn to develop iOS apps. Taking this into consideration, the foundations portion will be geared towards iOS development.

So why is learning iOS development and making your own apps or develop for someone else is so hard. Because you must learn five different topics to get an app into the store: 1) A programming Language; 2) iOS SDK; 3) iTunes Connect; 4) App design; 5) App store marketing; 6) Xcode (The Integrated Development Environment (IDE))
## Foundations
If you are completely new to Computer Science and Coding, and are interested in both, start here:

* CS50: https://cs50.harvard.edu

If you are just interested in starting to code and develop applications for iOS without getting into the Computer Science realm, start here:

* Ray Wenderlich iOS apprentice: https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/ios-apprentice
* Hacking with Swift: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read
* Apple's own Book, Free on iBooks: App Development with Swift. 

After you've gone through one of those courses, you are ready to understand the why. These two books are the best at it and will serve you as reference from now on:

* Big Nerd Ranch Swift: https://www.amazon.com/Swift-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/013461061X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499888896&sr=8-1&keywords=big+nerd+ranch+swift

BNR books are top notch and so is their blog, so it is worth checking it out for time to time. https://www.bignerdranch.com

It might be a worthwhile investment to look into Safari Books Online. They provide unlimited access to the majority of Technology books publishers like BNR, O'Reilly, No Starch Press, and Packet Pub. Check them out at https://www.safaribooksonline.com
